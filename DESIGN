This is a document describing how redshift works. It might be useful
if the normal docs don't answer a question, or when you want to hack
on the code.

redshift is a program written in C that tries to figure out the user's
location during startup, and then goes into an 'infinite loop' setting
the display gamma according to the time of day (details?). It reacts
to the SIGUSR1 signal by switching to day/night immediately.

gtk-redshift is a small program written in Python that shows a status
icon (what is an appindicator versus a GTK status icon?) (does it
change the icon according to internal program state of redshift? 
doesn't seem so) and run an instance of the "redshift" program, and
will send it SIGUSR1 each time the user clicks the icon.
